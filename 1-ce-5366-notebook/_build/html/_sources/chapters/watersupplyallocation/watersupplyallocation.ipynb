    "# Water Supply Allocation under Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction of uncertainty into an allocation problem creates a stochastic programming situation. There are a variety of methods to address stochastic programming, the next two examples illustrate a case where the problem is linear enough for a linear programming solution. Using LP for stochastic problems results in a large increase in the number of variables and constraints to account for alternative scenarios or in the use of chance constraints. These two approaches are explored in this chapter and the next – in this chapter we will examine two-stage linear programming by means of a simple example. The example will be repeated in the next chapter using a concept called \"chance constraints\"."

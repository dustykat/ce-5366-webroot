    "# Example: Reactor-Tank System\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a biological reactor system using the two-vessel feedback schematic in the Figure below. The system uses influent substrate, $S$, as an energy source (think food) to grow biomass, $X$, in the first vessel. The mixed liquor is then transferred to a clarifier tank where the liquid is decanted and the biomass is concentrated. The decanted liquid is returned to the environment (you can visualize the diagram as a water treatment system, where the substrate is some pollutant). The concentrated biomass is recycled back to the reactor tank as a way to ensure that the biomass population is sufficient for substrate removal.\n",

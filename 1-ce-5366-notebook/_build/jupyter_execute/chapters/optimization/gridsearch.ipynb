    "Grid search methods are simple to conceptualize and can provide useful starting values for more elaborate tools.  The substance manufacturing example used a simplistic grid search method that implicitly searched integer space only, here another example will use sequential searches - a first to get close to a region where good solutions exist, and a second refinement search.\n",

    "Suppose you are manufacturing two substances in your dorm room, $\\textbf{A}$ and $\\textbf{B}$, which can be sold for $\\$$120 per unit for substance $\\textbf{A}$ and $\\$$80 for substance $\\textbf{B}$.  Big Pharma (the cartel) requires that at least 1000 total units be manufactured each month.  Product $\\textbf{A}$ requires five hours of labor, product $\\textbf{B}$ requires three hours of labor per unit.  The cost of your labor is $\\$$12 per hour, and a total of 8000 hours per month of labor is available (basically your whole floor). Determine a production schedule that will maximize the net revenue.  \n",

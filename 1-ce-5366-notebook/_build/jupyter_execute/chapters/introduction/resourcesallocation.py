# # Resource Allocation
# 
# The prime focus (of this class) is water resources management, although I suspect the principles extend beyond that realm. 
# Water resources management is the activity of planning, developing, distributing and managing the optimum use of water resources. 
# Water resource management planning considers the competing demands for/on water (quantity, quality, location, and timing), and seeks to allocate a scarce resource (water) on an equitable basis to satisfy all uses and demands
# 
# Consider the meanings of **allocate**
# 
# 1. to apportion for a specific purpose or to particular persons or things : for example to allocate (distribute) tasks among human and automated components
# 2. to set apart or earmark : for example to allocate (designate) a section of the building for special research purposes
# 
# Consider the meanings of **equity**
# 
# 1. having or exhibiting equity : dealing fairly and equally with all concerned; an equitable settlement of the dispute
# 2. existing or valid in equity as distinguished from law; an equitable defense
# 
# Because the resource is scarce; allocation will necessarily deny the resource to some, and supply it
# to others. Equity implies some kind of “fairness” in that allocation.
# Allocation requires decisions be made and that is done by either an individual decision maker (like
# the president) or collective decision maker(s) (like a board of directors

# ## Decision Making Concepts
# 
# How do individuals and groups make decisions?
# 
# - Some people may seem indecisive or inconsistent. They may avoid making decisions as long as
# possible. The same reluctance to make decisions also happens in organizations or institutions.
# 
# - On the other hand, some people and groups may be accused of ”leaping to conclusions” or making a decision ”without considering all the facts.”
# 
# The dicotomy implies that decisions should be made by collecting and weighing various elements
# in a rational way. **Alternatives must exist**, or there is no decision required.
# 
# There are substantial psychological aspects in decision making, peoples choices are influenced by
# how the alternatives are presented. 
# 
# Consider Figure 1 below. The decision is select A or B, and the
# outcomes are shown. The upper panel presents the alternative in a survival context, whereas the
# lower panel presents the alternatives in a mortality context. Which is the best decision? 
# 
# ![](decisionprobability.png)
# 
# What we have so far are scarce resources, and a desire to alloctate fairly. 
# To allocate we need to make decisions; and decisions (by people) are emotional at the moment of the decision. Hence any tool to help make the decision (think spread the blame) is useful.
# 
# The challenge of resources management is to define “what is fair” for a situation; define alternatives
# (present a decision point); define and implement tools to support the decision.

# ## Tools to Support and Implement Decisions
# 
# Tools to support the decision will need to address
# 
# 1. Value of alternatives – how to measure “fairness”
# 2. Policy to rank the value(s)
# 3. Policy to guide the decision
# 
# It may be possible in a well defined situation to hand off the decision to an algorithm (narrow
# domain AI). An aircraft autopilot is an example of such a situation – but even that has risks; just
# ask Boeing!
# 
# Tools to implement the decision will need to address
# 
# - Do we control the system?
# 
# SCADA Algorithm operating a water distribution network — can probably be fully au-
# tonomous with little human intervention
# 
# - Do we just influence the system
# 
# Voluntary compliance versus risk of apprehension for water quality management

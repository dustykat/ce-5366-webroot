    "# Modeling for Decision Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and management decisions that are made about environmental and water resources systems, are based on what the decision-makers believe will take place as a result of their decisions. \n",
    "These predictions are either based on very qualitative informa-\n",
    "tion or, at least in part, on quantitative information provided by an analog (mouse model for drug toxicity; column study for pollutant transport; ...), and/or mathematical (computer-based) models. \n",
    "These quantitative mathematical models are considered essential for carrying out environmental impact assessments. \n",
    "Mathematical simulation and optimization models packaged within interactive computer programs provide a common way\n",

    "\n",
    "Modelling provides the principal way of predicting the behaviour of proposed infrastructural designs or management policies.

    "cations of models to real systems improves understanding, and contributes to improved system design, management and operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems motivating modelling and analyses exhibit a number of common characteristics:\n",

    ">A systems focus or orientation. In such situations atten-\n",

    "techniques, vocabulary and concepts of the other\n",
    "disciplines involved. Participation in interdisciplinary\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    ">The water resources system and the objectives being analysed are describable by reasonably tractable mathematical representations.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The information needed, such as the hydrological, economic, environmental and ecological impacts resulting from any decision, can be better estimated through the use of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The parameters of these models are estimable from readily obtainable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Building Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling approach distilled into a protocol (vaguely reminiscent of the scientific method) is summarized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the information the model is to provide. This includes criteria or measures of system performance that are of interest to stakeholders. These criteria or measures are defined as functions of the behaviour or state of the system being modelled. \n",
    "2. Model the behaviour so the state of the system associated with any ‘external’ inputs can be predicted. This requires modelling the physical, chemical, biological, economic, ecological and social processes that take place, as applicable, in the represented system. \n",
    "3. Integrate these two parts along with some means of entering the ‘external’ inputs and obtaining in meaningful ways the outputs.\n",
    "4. Calibrate and verify or validate. \n",
    "5. Apply the model to produce the information desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a fair amount of effort in the steps above, and a lot of art. But even using software for a specific situation involves these steps in some sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation models address \"what if\" questions: What will likely happen over time and at one or more specific places if a particular design and/or operating policy is implemented?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation works well when there are only a relatively few alternatives to be evaluated, not when there are a large number of them. The trial and error process of simulation is time consuming. An important role of optimization methods is to reduce the number of alternatives for simulation analyses. However, if only one method of analysis is to be used to evaluate a complex water resources system, simulation together with human judgement concerning which alternatives to simulate is often, and rightly so, the method of choice."

    "### Water Quality Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Water quality management has been mostly performed empirically, based mainly on political motivation and to a lesser extent on adequate scientific  information and analysis. \n",
    "The need for more scientifically sound analyses has led to the creation of a large number of water \n",
    "quality models; most of these models were developed for specific quality problems encountered in specific environmental and socioeconomic conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Water quality models can be classified according to the: \n",
    "- Type of approach (physically based, conceptual, empirical) \n",
    "- Pollutant item (nutrients, sediments, salts etc.) \n",
    "- Area of application (catchment, groundwater, river system, coastal waters, integrated) \n",

    "- State analysed (steady state or dynamic simulation) \n",
    "- Spatial analysis (lumped, distributed) \n",
    "-  Dimensions (1-D or 2-D models) \n",
    "- Data requirements (extensive databases, minimum requirements models (MIR)) \n",
    "\n",
    "Water quality models are the key tools to test the impact of various actions on the quality of water bodies. Any attempt for effective water resources management in a river basin could be supported by water quality modelling. Each type of water body (estuary, river ...) needs the appropriate type of model. \n",

    "Massey et al.1983, Deal et al.1986). The most recent DRAINMOD PC version is the 6.1 released \n",
    "on February 2012. DRAINMOD has been extended to predict the movement of nitrogen \n",

    "### Cost Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelling, (Darby ,2000), is the reduction of a real-world phenomenon of interest into a construct or set of constructs called symbolic models, which captures specific system behaviours. When applied to building project cost models, the model emulates the cost structure system, budget allocation, cost consumption and cost performance review within a project. Projects are often governed by constraints such as resources (budget, manpower, material and overheads), the project schedule, and the customer's project requirements etc. As an end effort, the cost model is often expressed on paper and worked out using calculator, before converting it into a software application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost models, like all models, have their own limitations. Models allow the model builder to emphasise or ignore certain aspects of the reality, depending upon the purpose of the model. Models inevitably overlook, rearrange or distort some details of the reality. A lack of correspondence between the reality and the model may lead to decisions being made on the basis of incorrect information (Beaman, Ranatunga, Krueger & Mudalige, 1998, p.3). Thus, the need for a good correlation between reality and model is a key goal of this research, which seeks to establish a set of success dimensions or criteria for the development of effective cost models for project cost management. A ‘dimensionally enhanced’ approach to cost modelling focuses on the ontological aspect, in defining the essential ‘what’ rather than the ‘how’ of the model. According to Banathy (1996), the ontological task is the formation of a systems view of what is in the broadest sense a systems view of the world. This can lead to a new orientation for scientific inquiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Systemic Approach To Cost Modelling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Banathy (1996, p.74) asserts that a systems view enables exploration and characterization of the system of our interest, its environment, and its components and parts. We can acquire a systems view by *integrating* systems concepts and principles into our thinking and learning and the way we represent our experiences and our world. When adapted to a costing system, the systems view represents an inquiry process that will generate the following insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Characteristics of the “embeddedness” of costing systems operating at several interconnected levels (e.g. project management, cost modelling, end-user operation, senior manager reporting, system administration, organisation learning, financial and business process improvement levels).\n",
    "- Relationships, interactions, and mutual interdependencies of systems operating at those levels.\n",
    "- The purposes, goals, and boundaries of costing systems.\n",
    "- Relationships, interactions, and information/data/instructions exchanges between systems and their environment.\n",
    "- Dynamics of the interactions, relationships, and patterns of connectedness amongst the components of the costing systems.\n",
    "- Properties of wholeness and the characteristics that emerge at various systems levels as a result of systemic interaction and synthesis.\n",
    "- System processes, and the behaviour and change of system and their environment over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--The Inquiry Process for Cost Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "According to McDermott (1981), inquiry is the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations, as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole. During the inquiry process, a set of ‘guiding questions’ is needed to help the project managers to capture the essential information needed to build the cost model. In this research, the set of ‘guiding questions’ is embodied in the list of nine success criteria identified as being necessary to achieve effective cost modelling. The nine success criteria were first derived from a 9-step process for building the life cycle costing (LCC) model for vehicle fleet management that I had adopted in my course of work. The 9-step LCC process was evolved from the combination of my practical experience as a project manager and personal learning from the literature\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to translate the nine steps into a set of ontological codes, I had used the sequence of six grounded theory actions proposed by Professor Bob Dick (2002) to condense my data and derive the success criteria for project cost modelling. The following actions were carried out for each of the LCC steps: data collection, note-taking, coding, memoing, sorting and writing. The following exhibit shows the coding and sorting of the entire set of nine LCC modelling steps and the associated themes. The third column shows the final codes that would represent the success criteria for project cost modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](p3_01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These codes can be grouped into three perspectives of cost modelling, namely structural, investment and results as shown in the final column. The criteria are grouped as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Criterion 1 to 3 - Structural perspective of the PCM\n",
    "   - Criterion 4 to 6 - Investment perspective of the PCM\n",
    "   - Criterion 7 to 9 - Results perspective of the PCM -->\n",
